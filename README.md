As this repository primarily serves as an archive of my past school studies, I am not actively accepting contributions directly to this repository.

# Disclaimer

Please note that the studies in this repository reflect my understanding of Linux server management during my school years. While I strive for well-documented and effective configurations, there may be areas for improvement as I continue to grow as a Linux server administrator.

# Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the work of My Teachers for creating the learning materials and exercises related to Linux server management. While I have learned and completed these practical exercises, the credit for their design and creation goes to him. I am grateful for the effort and expertise that went into developing these.

Happy server management!
